# My Project üíº : 

- [Corrective RAG (CRAG) for Document Retrieval üï∏Ô∏èüîóü¶ú](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/Corrective-RAG) : This small project implements the **[Corrective RAG (CRAG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15884)** paper for enhancing document retrieval and question answering. 

- [ReflectRAG üï∏Ô∏èü¶ú](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/ReflectRAG) : ReflectRAG is a non-official implementation inspired by the paper **[Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511)**

- [Agentic RAG Service ü§ñ ü¶ô](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/Agentic-RAG-Service) : This project leverages the **Llama-Agents** framework to build a sophisticated **multi-agent system** that integrates a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** approach using the **llama-index query engines** and a powerful LLM for enhanced information retrieval and processing.

- [EvalMasterü¶ô](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/EvalMaster) : A small evaluation project leveraging the power of the **LlamaIndex** and **Llama-CPP** frameworks, along with the cutting-edge **Prometheus-2** model. This project aims to provide a robust and flexible evaluation tool for assessing the performance of RAG system using various evaluation metrics.

- [SmartQuery ü¶úÔ∏èüîó](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/SmartQuery) : This small project leverages the power of **LangChain** to create an **advanced conversational agent** with sophisticated query retrieval capabilities. We utilize state-of-the-art embedding models, vector storage, and reranking mechanisms to ensure high-quality responses and interactions.


- [RAGoGraphü¶úüîó](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/RAGoGraph) : RAGoGraph is a small project designed to seamlessly **convert text** into a **knowledge graph** and leverage this **structured data** within a **conversational agent**. 

- [QuerySynthü¶ô](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/QuerySynth) : QuerySynth is a Simple **information retrieval chat system** designed to provide accurate and insightful responses to user queries. Leveraging state-of-the-art models and a **hybrid search** approach, it is capable of handling both **general questions** and **complex queries** by **breaking them down** into manageable parts. The project integrates multiple advanced technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

- [FinanceCrew](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/FinanceCrew) : FinanceCrew is a Simple project built using **CrewAI**, designed to automate and orchestrate tasks related to financial analysis and data collection. This project leverages multiple agents with specific roles to fetch financial information, perform calculations, and gather relevant news from various sources.

- [RAGnetic](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/RAGnetic) : This Simple project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **DSPy**. RAG allows **Language Models (LLMs)** to leverage a large corpus of knowledge to dynamically retrieve relevant passages and generate well-refined responses. **DSPy** facilitates the setup of **RAG pipelines** by providing **tools** for **optimizing prompts** and **managing the flow** of information between **retrieval** and **generation stages**.

- [LLM Playground](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/Mesop-LLM-Playground) : a powerful and intuitive web app built using **Mesop** by **Google**. This playground allows you to seamlessly interact with and compare responses from three advanced language models:
    - **Command-R-Plus** by *Cohere*
    - **Gemini 1.5 Flash** by *Google*
    - **Llama3-8B-8192** by *Meta AI*

- [Data-Gen](https://github.com/Kirouane-Ayoub/Data-Gen) : Data-Gen is LLM Data Generator a Simple Python project designed to **generate datasets** for **training (LLMs)** using **existing LLMs**. The project supports multiple LLM providers and allows for flexible configuration of text splitting, model generation, and data saving formats.
